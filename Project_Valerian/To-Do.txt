Project Valerian To-Do List

* Scaffolds where there weren't enough items to create job originally need to periodically check to see if there are enough items now
* Create UI for production jobs
* Fix the UI for tracking job goals so it updates whenever a new job is chosen
* Scan_For_Storable_Items needs to handle more than just ore, need a flag in the item flat file that flags an item as storeable
